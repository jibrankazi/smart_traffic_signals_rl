# Smart Traffic Signals with Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources for developing a deep reinforcementâ€‘learning agent to optimize traffic light timings in a simulated urban environment. The goal is to reduce vehicle wait times and congestion by learning adaptive traffic signal policies.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Placeholder for any collected datasets or logs. Raw and processed data should be stored in subdirectories.
- **models/**: Stores trained model weights or checkpoints.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation, simulation setup, and exploratory analysis.
- **src/**: Source code modules for building the traffic environment, training agents, and evaluation.
- **reports/**: Generated analysis reports and summaries.
- **visualizations/**: Plots and GIFs illustrating training progress and results.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data exploration, environment setup, and training scripts.
3. Run the training scripts in `src/` to train your own RL agent.

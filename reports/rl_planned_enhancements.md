# Planned Enhancements for the Smart Traffic Signals RL Project

To raise this project to research‑grade quality, we will implement several enhancements addressing evaluation rigor, baseline comparisons, and interpretability.  
These additions will help ensure the reported improvements are credible and that the learned policy is understandable.

## 1. Stronger Baseline Comparisons

The original study only compared the DQN agent to a fixed‑cycle traffic signal controller.  
To demonstrate the practical impact of our RL approach, we will benchmark against at least two additional control strategies:

- **Actuated control** – a responsive heuristic widely used in real traffic systems that adjusts signal phases based on sensor data (e.g., queue lengths or vehicle presence).  
- **Max‑pressure control** – a well‑known algorithm in traffic research that prioritizes movements with the greatest imbalance between incoming and outgoing queues.  
- **Tabular Q‑learning** – retained as a baseline for small networks but now clearly separated from deep RL experiments.

Including these baselines and carefully tuning their parameters will provide a fairer point of comparison and demonstrate whether the DQN truly outperforms established methods.

## 2. Statistical Evaluation Across Multiple Runs

Deep RL results can vary widely due to stochastic initialization and environment randomness.  
To avoid over‑interpreting a single training run, we will:

- Train and evaluate each controller (DQN and baselines) using **multiple random seeds** (e.g., 5–10 runs).  
- Report the **mean and standard deviation or 95 % confidence interval** of key metrics (average waiting time, travel time, throughput) across runs.  
- Use **statistical tests** such as a paired t‑test or non‑parametric Wilcoxon test to verify that the RL agent’s performance gains over baselines are statistically significant.

These practices follow current recommendations for reproducible reinforcement‑learning research【520273785081046†L50-L63】 and will help reviewers trust the reported improvements.

## 3. Interpretability and Policy Insights

Traffic control is a safety‑critical application; decision makers should understand why a learned policy takes particular actions.  
We plan to add interpretability analyses such as:

- **Feature importance with SHAP values** – treat the neural network (or value function) as a function of state features and compute SHAP values to identify which inputs (e.g., queue lengths, wait times) most influence each action【439831869724999†L93-L107】.  
- **Visualization of learned policy** – for the tabular Q‑learning baseline, visualize the Q‑table or policy heat maps to show how control decisions vary with state variables.  
- **Policy description** – describe patterns in the DQN’s policy (e.g., prioritizing clearing long queues) and compare them to human heuristics.

Providing these insights will enhance the transparency of the RL agent and align the project with the growing demand for explainable AI in high‑stakes domains【705295093246900†L186-L242】.

## 4. Documentation and Reporting

Along with the code changes, we will update the project documentation:

- Include the above planned enhancements in the README or a dedicated section within `reports/` to inform reviewers about ongoing work.
- Present new results in clear tables and plots (e.g., learning curves with confidence bands, comparison tables for baselines).
- Discuss limitations and future work, such as exploring multi‑agent or network‑level RL approaches.

These improvements will transform the current engineering prototype into a research‑oriented project that satisfies expectations for rigorous evaluation, strong baselines, and interpretability.
